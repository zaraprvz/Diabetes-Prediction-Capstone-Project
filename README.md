This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes using a machine learning model. The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains various health-related features.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset and any data processing scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for each phase of the project.
- `src/`: Source code for the machine learning model and application.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the Flask application.
- `reports/`: Reports and figures generated during the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-capstone.git
